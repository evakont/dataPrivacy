dataPrivacy
===========
Publishing data containing personal information about individuals is needed to export
statistical conclusions. The publication of these data without revealing the true identity of
individuals is an important problem. These data contain personal information, therefore the
information should be hidden. It is possible, however, an attacker to be able to combine data
from various published sources and his information to break the data anonymization. In this
paper we present a tool for visualizing an existing implementation of algorithms for data
anonymization. Specifically, with the implemented tool the user can regulate the process of
anonymisation on a specific data set with respect to the following competitive criteria: (a) the
degree of privacy achieved by the anonymisation algorithm, (b) the number of records deleted
as outliers and (c) the degree of generalization of the data set.
